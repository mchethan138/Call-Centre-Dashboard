The goal is to optimize operations by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), evaluating agent efficiency, and identifying call timing patterns for better resource allocation.

Becky answered 81.9% of calls.

Calls Resolved (Y/N): Breakdown of resolved vs. unresolved cases.

Becky resolved 73.22% of issues.

Call Volume by Day: A bar chart shows daily call trends, separated by answered vs. missed calls.

Topic-Wise Analysis:

Calls Answered by Topic: Identifies high-volume topics like "Payment related", "Streaming", and "Admin Support".
